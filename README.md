## Setup Steps to Run on your Local Host.

Download this repository's zip file and unzip it into a work directory.
Example work directory:
```
/Projects/OwlCc
```

Note, the Twilio PHP helper library is included in the subdirectory:
```
/Projects/OwlCc/twilio-php-master
```

In the project directory, edit setvars.sh and add your values.
```
ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_SID
AUTH_TOKEN=your_account_auth_token
WORKSPACE_SID=your_TaskRouter_workspace_SID
```

Set your terminal session's environment variables.
```
$ source ./setvars.sh
+++ Set variables.
+ Variables set.
---------------------------------------
+++ Echo environment variables and test the environment.
+ ACCOUNT_SID   : your_account_SID
+ AUTH_TOKEN    : your_account_auth_token
+ Test the loading and using of the Twilio PHP helper library.
+ Twilio PHP Helper Library Client is working.
---------------------------------------
+ Worker SID for testing the generation of tokens: your_TaskRouter_worker_SID
+ Worker Client token created.
+ WORKSPACE_SID : your_TaskRouter_workspace_SID
+ Worker token created.
--------------------------------------- 
```

Also, in echoVars.php, workerSid to one of your TaskRouter workers.
```
$workerSid = "WK10ec1823ae8a54d715ba424599ea473f";
```

Run the PHP HTTP server using port 8000.
```
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Test that it works. In your browser, goto: http://localhost:8000.
The Owl CC home pages is displayed.

In another terminal window, run Ngrok to allow notifications of incoming agent calls.
```
$ /Users/dthurston/Applications/ngrok http 8000
...
```

Connect as an agent by going to the Ngrok URL, example:
```
http://706bf85f.ngrok.io/agent_list
```

## Updates to make

- Desktop: Set TTL for the token using an environment variable.
- Agent List: enter a password to pass to the Desktop to authorize token generation.
-- Access password is an environment variable.
- Desktop: When putting an agent status to offline when clicking "Return", should do checks. 
- When Agent clicks Go Available, need to insure that there are no Tasks with the agent's name that are Assignment Status: wrapping.
